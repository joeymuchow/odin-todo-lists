# odin-todo-lists

This is a project from The Odin Project's Javascript course where we create a todo list web app. The app gives you the ability to create projects that can have todo lists attached to them and those todo lists have todo items.

Working on this project made me realize that I need to do a better job at planning out what I should create into smaller chunks I can manage. Multiple times throughout this project I found myself making one feature and then something would come up that diverts my attention or go on a tangent thinking about how things would work in a different place that leads to another tangent and so on. This one has taken me the most time to complete, which I guess makes sense in that each project will probably be more work each time.

Overall I am mostly fine with what I have done, though the styling leaves a lot to be desired I think. The best part of this project was me noticing my progress on this project was not great at times and re-focusing myself on what I need to get done.
